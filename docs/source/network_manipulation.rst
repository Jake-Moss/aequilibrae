Network Manipulation
====================

In this section, we discuss how can we import and export data to/from an AequilibraE project.
Besides, important concepts on geometry manipulation are presented. Finally, some examples that
involve project creation, edition of links and nodes, and identification of disconnected links
for network clean up are presented.

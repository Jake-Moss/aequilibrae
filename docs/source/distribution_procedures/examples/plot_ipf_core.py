.. _plot_ipf_core:

Running IPF with NumPy array
============================

In this example, we show how to use ``aequilibrae.distribution.ipf_core``, a high-performance 
alternative for all those who want to (re)balance values within a matrix making direct use of
growth factors. ``ipf_core`` was built to suit countless applications rather than being limited
to trip distribution.

We demonstrate the usage of ``ipf_core`` with a 4x4 matrix with 64-bit data, which is indeed very
small. Additionally, a more comprehensive discussion of the algorithm's performance
with a 32-bit or 64-bit seed matrices is provided in :doc:`../IPF_benchmark`.

The data used in this example comes from Table 5.6 in 
`Ort√∫zar & Willumsen (2011) <https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Modelling+Transport%2C+4th+Edition-p-9780470760390>`_.

# Let's print our updated matrix

# Notice that the matrix value was updated, and results are the same as in :ref:`plot_ipf_without_model`
# - and this is no coincidence. Under the hood, when we call ``aequilibrae.distribution.Ipf``, we 
# are actually calling the ``ipf_core`` method.

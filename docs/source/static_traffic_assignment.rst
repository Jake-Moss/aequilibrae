Static Traffic Assignment
=========================

Performing traffic assignment or computing paths through a network is always a little different in 
each platform, and in AequilibraE is no exception, but we strive to make the static traffic assignment 
process as simple as possible so that seasoned modelers can easily migrate their models and workflows 
to the platform.

Although modeling with AequilibraE should feel somewhat familiar to seasoned modelers, especially
those used to programming, the mechanics of traffic assignment in AequilibraE might be foreign to
some users, so this section of the documentation will include discussions of the mechanics
of some of these procedures and some light discussion on its motivation.

Distribution Procedures
=======================

In the context of transportation modeling, a distribution model tries to estimate the number of 
trips in each of the matrix cells on the basis of any information available [1]_. 

In the following sections, we present the classes that comprise AequilibraE's distribution module,
as well as present a benchmark validation for the IPF procedure and some usage examples.
